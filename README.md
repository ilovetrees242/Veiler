# Veiler
This repository contains code related to my package manager for LFS. I want to use LFS as my main system everyday, yes that's right! Some people do want to daily drive their LFS system but package management is the biggest issue they all encounter. So I create my own for myself, and maybe others soon  

# NOTE

This was made for my use mostly, its still under development so some packages might not get managed properly or some packages might break other packages. When I think it's atleast somewhat usable I will publish its code in releases
